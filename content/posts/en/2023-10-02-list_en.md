## Building Idempotent Functions: Master tips for Cloud Functions

##### By Arnaud Joye

Let's revive an old but significant subject, transcribed in a blog by [Slawomir Walkowski](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/cloud-functions-pro-tips-building-idempotent-functions?hl=en), a Software Engineer at Google Cloud. In this post, we delve into building idempotent functions to enhance the resiliency of your serverless systems.

#### Unveiling Idempotent Functions

In computer science, idempotence guarantees that a function will yield consistent results - no matter how many times you execute it. When executing a function multiple times for a specific event, the resulting outcome stays the same, only then do we say the function is idempotent. 

The crux of idempotent functions lies in the retry aspect. When a function fails, we might need to retry it to ensure correct behavior. However, the challenge appears if the re-execution generates undesired results or side effects. This is where building the function to be idempotent saves the day. 

Let's clarify this idea with an example, a simple data processing function that writes results to two separate storage systems. Do you anticipate the problem here? What if the upload fails in one of the storages? As a quick solution, you may retry the function. It will certainly save the data to the second storage system (provided the upload is successful), but it will also duplicate the record into the first storage system, leading to potential inconsistencies.

How do we circumvent this? Let’s dive deeper.

### Craft Your Function with Idempotency

How about we tweak a non-idempotent function into an idempotent one? Let’s take an instance where a document is first added to Cloud Firestore and then uploaded to a separate storage system. If the upload to Cloud Firestore turns successful, but the second upload fails, retrying just doubles the same document into the Cloud Firestore. This is what we intend to avoid.

**Embrace your Event IDs** 

A viable solution to this dilemma is using the Event ID - which uniquely identifies an event that triggers a background function. Upon using the Event ID as a document ID, and by writing document contents to Cloud Firestore, we ensure the idempotent functionality of our data storage and uploads. In simpler terms, a retried function execution doesn't add a new document, but instead, overrides the existing one with the same content. So, it prevents data duplication or leftover work. To follow this principle, you can provide the Event ID as your idempotency key in some particular APIs (e.g., [Stripe](https://stripe.com/blog/idempotency)).

**Dealing with Non-idempotent Systems**

Now, what if the system you are working with doesn’t support idempotency? Consider the SendGrid email delivery service. A retried function here could lead to duplicate emails. To counter this, you can mark the handled events by recording their Event ID. This significantly reduces the chance of unanticipated retried calls to other services.

**Incorporating the Lease Mechanism**

Though the approaches mentioned above eliminate the majority of duplicated calls on function retries, there's a fringe chance of parallel retried executions happening more than once. Using a lease mechanism is a good practice here. When worked strategically, this mechanism let you carry out the non-idempotent section of the function exclusively for a specific duration. 

Therefore, while designing your serverless architecture, ensuring idempotency can drastically increase the reliability of your setups. As we have seen, several ways from using Event IDs to operate a lease mechanism can help achieve idempotency. If you're willing to go further, you can check [cloud.google.com/functions/](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) and the code used in the [GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-functions-reliability-nodejs/tree/master/idempotency).

So, heed these tips and tricks, and make your serverless systems more resilient and foolproof.
