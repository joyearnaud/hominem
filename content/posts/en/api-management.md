## What is API Mangement?

API Management is a set of processes for `designing, publishing, documenting and analyzing APIs` within a secure environment.

This process makes it possible to make the best use of the APIs without jeopardizing the information system and without affecting the user experience. It is a management solution that allows companies `to ensure that the public/internal or private APIs they design are usable and secure`.

API Management covers a wide spectrum of uses because it operates at several levels:

- Technical (security, high availability, data validation, â€¦)
- Architecture (gateway proxy)
- Data governance
- Organizational

## How to deal with it?

It comes with `new concepts with which the business and technical teams must become familiar`. This goes through a learning phase in which the organization must also integrate new functions and new modes of governance. These relate to a `necessary product API mindset` which extends from the marketing of APIs to their distribution and commercialization.

### Tools

Management tools may include, among other examples:

#### Acculturation

Acculturation can refer to the process of introducing new technologies, processes, or ways of thinking to a team or organization and helping them to adjust to and integrate these changes into their daily work. It helps ensure that teams and organizations can adapt to new tools and approaches and effectively leverage them to achieve their goals

##### API Manifesto

`writing a unified business API vision between the teams with constraint and business necessities`

A manifesto is a public declaration of an organization's intentions, goals, and values related to their API program. It outlines the principles that guide the organization's approach to API design, development, deployment, and management.

The manifesto serves as a reference point for the organization and its stakeholders to ensure that their actions align with their stated values and goals. It also helps to communicate the organization's priorities and approach to API management to external parties, such as developers who may be building applications that consume the organization's APIs.

A manifesto may cover a variety of topics related to API management, such as security, scalability, developer experience, and openness. For example, an API management manifesto may prioritize ease of use for developers, advocate for the use of industry-standard security protocols, and encourage collaboration with external developers and partners.

*By creating an API management manifesto, an organization can establish a clear vision for their API program and provide guidance and direction for all those involved in its development and management.*

##### API's workshop

`collaborative session for continuous improvement`

A workshop is a collaborative session in which a group of stakeholders, such as developers, architects, product owners, and business analysts, come together to explore, design, and develop APIs. Workshops can take place at various stages of the API lifecycle, from ideation to deployment and maintenance.

During a workshop, the participants work together to define the scope and requirements of the API project, identify potential use cases, and create a roadmap for API development. The workshop may also include activities such as API design, documentation, testing, and deployment planning.

Workshops can be led by API experts or facilitated by a neutral third-party. The workshop format encourages collaboration and communication among stakeholders, leading to a better understanding of the needs of the organization and its customers. Workshops can also help to identify potential roadblocks and challenges early in the development process, which can save time and resources in the long run.

*Workshops are a valuable tool in API management that can help organizations to create well-designed, well-documented, and well-supported APIs that meet the needs of both internal and external stakeholders.*

##### API Roadmap

`with the appearance of new norms and standards and the business evolution obliges to perceive and provide milstones`

A roadmap is a strategic plan that outlines the goals, milestones, and timelines for an API project or program. The roadmap provides a high-level overview of the planned features, functionalities, and improvements to be delivered through the API.

The roadmap typically includes information on the API's release schedule, key features and enhancements, target user groups, and any other important details relevant to the project's success. It may also include timelines for testing, implementation, and other necessary activities.

Roadmaps are typically developed by product owners or other stakeholders in collaboration with developers and API teams. The roadmap helps ensure that everyone involved in the project is aligned and working towards the same goals and objectives.

Roadmaps can be an important tool for API management as they provide a clear plan for API development and help to ensure that resources are allocated appropriately. They also help to manage expectations among stakeholders and communicate progress towards the API's goals.

*A roadmap is an essential component of API management as it provides a roadmap for the development and evolution of APIs, enabling organizations to plan, track, and optimize their API programs for maximum success.*

#### Technical approach
  
As discused, acculturation tools are designed to help educate and onboard API involved user, from development to production, with the goal of increasing adoption and usage of the APIs and it's mindset.

Technical tools, on the other hand, are designed to support the development, management, and monitoring of APIs. These tools typically provide features such as API testing, version control, security management, and performance monitoring. They are designed to support the technical aspects of API management, such as ensuring the APIs are secure, performant, and meet technical requirements.

Technical tools focus on providing a robust and reliable API platform, with the goal of ensuring the APIs are available, scalable, and performant. They aim to support the technical needs of API developers, IT teams, and other stakeholders responsible for the API platform.

##### API gateway

`aims to direct API traffic and to link the networks together (client with services, etc.). It is possible to group a collection of management servers and gateway servers together to create clusters to balance the load and isolate traffic`

An API gateway (or reverse proxy) plays a crucial role in API management by acting as an intermediary between the client and the backend services that provide the API. The gateway provides a single entry point for all API requests and is responsible for managing and routing these requests to the appropriate backend service.

One of the main functions of an gateway is to handle requests and responses between the client and the backend API services. It receives incoming requests from clients and forwards them to the appropriate API service. It also handles the responses from the API service and sends them back to the client.

In addition to request and response handling, an API gateway provides several other important functions for API management. These include:

1. Security: An gateway can enforce security policies, such as authentication and authorization, to ensure that only authorized clients can access the API services.

2. Traffic management: An gateway can control the rate at which requests are sent to API services to prevent overload or denial of service attacks.

3. Protocol translation: An gateway can translate requests and responses between different protocols to allow clients to use different communication protocols than the backend API services.

4. Caching: An gateway can cache frequently accessed responses to reduce the load on backend services and improve API performance.

5. Analytics and monitoring: An gateway can collect and analyze data on API usage, performance, and errors, providing insights into the health of the API platform.

*Gateway is a critical component of API management, providing essential features for handling requests, managing traffic, enforcing security, and monitoring API usage. **This is the key fundation of next tools**.*

##### API Publication

`Its the tool that provider use to define APIs, their access and usage policies, debugging execution as well as managing their API lifecycle APIs`

Publication tool are often packaged within the Gateway application.

An publication tool is a software application that helps provider create, design, and publish their APIs. This tool is typically used by developers, architects, and other IT professionals to define the endpoints and methods of an API, create documentation, generate sample code, and manage API access, such as authentication and authorization.

The main purpose of an publication tool is to make it easier for developers to create and publish APIs by providing a set of user-friendly tools and interfaces. It typically includes a graphical user interface (GUI) or a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to define and manage the API's resources, parameters, and methods. This interface may also provide wizards or templates to help users configure the API and create documentation.

Some publication tools also support a range of programming languages, allowing developers to write code in their language of choice. They may also support API standards such as OpenAPI, Swagger, and RAML, which help standardize the way APIs are defined and documented.

Once an API is published, an publication tool may also provide features to manage and monitor its usage. This might include usage analytics, logging, and monitoring tools to track performance, identify issues, and optimize the API's performance.

*Publication tool is an essential component of API management, as it helps organizations create and publish high-quality APIs that are easy to use and integrate into applications.*

##### API Portal

`is a community site for API subscribers who are maintained by provider. It includes documentation, interactive API console for testing APIs, ability to subscribe to APIs and manage subscriptions, and API vendor or community support service`

As for Gateway/Publication, it is not common to separate the publication tool from the portal tool, as they are often integrated into a single platform. However, it is possible to separate them conceptually to understand their individual roles in the API management process.

An portal tool is focused on providing a user-friendly, web-based interface where developers can discover, learn about, and manage APIs. This might include documentation, sample code, testing and debugging tools, access to analytics and reporting, and features for managing API access that were published by the provider with publication tool.

One of the main functions of an portal is to provide developers with clear and concise documentation that describes the API's functionality, inputs, outputs, and response codes. This documentation should be easy to understand and navigate, and might include code examples in different programming languages that demonstrate how to interact with the API.

Another key feature of an portal is its developer community. Many portals include forums, discussion boards, and other collaboration tools that allow developers to share knowledge and ask questions about the APIs they are using. This community can be a valuable resource for developers who are new to the APIs, as well as experienced developers who want to share best practices and learn from their peers.

*Portal is an essential component of API management, as it provides a user-friendly interface for developers to discover, learn about, and manage APIs. They are essential for promoting API adoption, driving innovation, and improving developer experience.*

##### API Reporting

`data communication and analysis tool allowing to have a clear visibility on the use of the API. It is also a marketing tool that allows the behavior of subscribers to be measured and thus allows the publisher of the API to optimize its offer`

After desgining and publishing an API from publication tool, users can suscribes to them on portal. Them provider needs to monitor its usage and performance to ensure that it is meeting the needs of its users. This is where reporting comes in.

Reporting plays an important role in API management by providing visibility into how they are used and performed. It allows provider to track key metrics such as traffic, usage patterns, response times, errors, and success rates. By analyzing this data, provider can gain insights into how their APIs are being consumed, identify potential issues, and make informed decisions to improve API performance, scalability, and security.

Reporting also enables providers to monitor the usage of their APIs and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and service level agreements. It allows them to generate custom reports and dashboards to visualize usage and performance metrics, and share them with stakeholders to demonstrate the business value of APIs.

*Reporting is an essential component of API management, providing valuable insights and analytics to optimize API performance and drive business outcomes.*

##### API Monetization

`the API access monetization service makes it possible to monetize the APIs hosted by the chosen API provider.`

After designing, publishing, and monitoring usage and performance through reporting, providers may want to monetize by charging fees for access or usage. Publishing rules and Monitoring are essential for successful monetization as it enables provider to make data-driven decisions about pricing, usage, and performance, ultimately maximizing the value of their APIs.

Monetization refers to the process of generating revenue from APIs by charging for their usage or by creating new revenue streams through the use of APIs. In API management, monetization plays a critical role in ensuring the success and sustainability of an API program.

Providers can monetize their APIs in several ways, such as charging subscription fees, usage-based fees, transaction fees, or offering tiered pricing models. API monetization can also involve creating new revenue streams by enabling partners and developers to build value-added applications and services on top of the APIs.

Monetization requires careful planning and execution, including defining pricing models, setting pricing levels, and establishing billing and payment processes. Effective monetization strategies can help provider generate new revenue streams, increase customer loyalty, and drive innovation and growth.

Monetization also plays a critical role in justifying the investment in API development and management, by demonstrating the value and ROI to stakeholders and executives.

*Monetization is an important aspect of API management, helping providers to create sustainable and profitable API programs.*

## Outro

The process of API management starts with designing and publishing an API using publication tools, followed by portal tools for user subscription and management. Then, monitoring and reporting tools are used to ensure that the APIs are meeting user needs and performing well.

Monetization comes into play once the APIs are established and being used effectively. It involves creating pricing models and payment structures, setting up billing and invoicing systems, and managing revenue streams. Therefore, while monetization is important, it is just one component of a larger, ongoing API management process that requires a variety of tools and strategies to ensure success.

`API Management solutions are essential to help organizations succeed with their API programs. These solutions provide a secure and scalable platform to manage APIs and ensure that the APIs can be accessed quickly and securely by the people who need them. They also provide analytics and insights into how the APIs are being used, allowing organizations to measure their success. Additionally, API management solutions can enable organizations to monetize their APIs and ensure that their usage is documented and tracked for compliance. By leveraging an API management solution, organizations can boost their API programs' success and maximize the value they bring to the enterprise.`
